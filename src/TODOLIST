!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UPDATE IN PHASE 2:
    For a proper game over, some lines of code is added to LE and Game(available in phase 4 version).
        Essentially, we passed the Game object to Logic Engine in its constructor and in LE, when the game was about to finish
        (right next to saving mechanism), set data.LERunning, data.GERunning = false to terminate these two threads. also,
        when exiting run method of Logic Engine(after main while loop) add a line of code: this.game.load_player_selection();.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Phase 3:
Done: break Data class to StaticData and DynamicData classes. First one contains transient fields of Data.
todo: handle screenSize related calculations(dependent on Toolkit.getDefa..) so that it is fixed in multi-player game with players having different screensized
    one possible fix, is to not have the game run on full screen and on a smaller window.

Done: shot cool down and time between shots in multi-player.
Done: move shootbomb mechanism from gamePanel to LE completely.(currently shoot bomb doesn't work in multi-player)
Done: player should be dynamic and score and other info's should be updated
todo: Enemy2s behaviour in multi-player.
Done: add serverWaiting panel and other multi player panels.
Done: pause menu handling
Done: single player pause menu broke:(
Done: Level manager seems to not work
PRIORITY3: DONE(kinda:)  todo: Exception handling.
Done: client death handling.
Done: observer
todo: Proper game over and game ending.

Done: pressedKeyNamePair can be a hash map.

*Done(single player Logic Engine still works with Shot fields): heat increment should be implemented in logic engine rather than in shot constructors.
*Done: collision handler code is ugly:) use ClientsDataOnServer to better implement it.
*Done: changing enemies health in multi-player depending on number of players.

Phase 4:
Database:
Done: add Database connection to single player.
Done: update database when saved.
Done: update database ranking when game is finished.
Aborted: read ranking from db. No need to do this.
Done: close database connection on exit.
Done: saving in multiPlayer(should it be disabled?) Saving is deactivated in multi player.

Reflection:
todo: Loading an enemy class
todo: menu for adding enemy class
todo: adding new enemies of a new type using reflection and its Class to the enemy queue
todo: adding new enemies in multiplayer.(no need to send image and stuff to clients for now)
todo: creating new Boss class(to test reflection).
todo: creating new Enemy class(to test reflection).



Miscellaneous:
DONE(but hard-coded:)): Saving mechanism doesn't load from where it is supposed to when a player resumes the game. should only add the needed Waves when creating LevelManager and adding waves to its wave list.
