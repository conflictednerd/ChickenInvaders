# ChickenInvaders
An implementation of chicken invaders using java swing.

This was my final project for the "advanced programming" course.

Besides the main graphical challenges, the game also includes a multi-player mode (networking), dynamic run-time modification of game files (using reflection), saving and loading capabilities (database integration)
